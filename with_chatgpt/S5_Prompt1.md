I'm building a Snake game AI using Deep Q-learning. Sometimes, the AI just loops around without eating food or hitting anything. I want to change the reward system so the AI:
•	Gets a reward for getting closer to the food.
•	Gets a penalty for getting too close to the walls or itself.
Can you help me update the reward system for this? Please tell me exactly what to change in the code.
Here is the SnakeGameAI class:"      "
